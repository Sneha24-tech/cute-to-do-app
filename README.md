# 🌸 Aesthetic To-Do List Web App 🌸

## 🧠 What I Learned 

### This project was my first step into real-world web development. I used Python Flask to manage the backend logic and routing. HTML and CSS gave life to my frontend, styled with love to match my aesthetic preferences. 

  🧠 I learnt:
- Creating interactive UIs with HTML, CSS, and JS
- Integrating Python with frontend using Flask routes
- Structuring HTML forms and handling user input
- Running a local Flask server
- Using templates with Jinja2 (`{{ }}` syntax)

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Sneha24-tech/cute-to-do-app.git

# 2. Navigate into the project folder
cd cute-to-do-app

# 3. Run the app
python app.py

```

### Then go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/splash ✨
### A live webpage will open with a splash window and along with that the aesthetic to-do app will be visible on your screen
