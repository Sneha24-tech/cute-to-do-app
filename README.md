# 🌸 Aesthetic To-Do List Web App 🌸  
_A beautifully designed To-Do List app using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Flask**_

## ✨ Overview

This project is a beginner-friendly web app that helps users keep track of their daily tasks with a clean and aesthetic user interface. It reflects my early journey into the world of **full-stack web development** and how I’m learning to combine **frontend creativity** with **backend logic**.
